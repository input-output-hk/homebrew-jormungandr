This is a homebrew tap for the jormungandr blockchain service

First, you need to add the tap :

```shell
brew tap input-output-hk/jormungandr
```

then install jormungandr from this new tap:

```shell
brew install jormungandr
```

or the fully qualified form (if you might have a duplicated jormungandr formula):

```shell
brew install input-output-hk/jormungandr/jormungandr
```
