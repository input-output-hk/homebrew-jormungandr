Jormungandr Homebrew Tap
========================

This is a [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) tap for the jormungandr blockchain service.

First, you need to add the tap:

```shell
brew tap input-output-hk/jormungandr
```

### Latest released version :office:

then install jormungandr from this new tap:

```shell
brew install jormungandr
```

or equivalently the fully qualified form (if you might have a duplicated jormungandr formula):

```shell
brew install input-output-hk/jormungandr/jormungandr
```

### Unreleased head version :godmode:

Also can be used to install the latest git version, which is not
recommended for normal use cases:

```shell```
brew install --HEAD jormungandr
```
